I am very preferential to c# for a couple of reasons.
  1. I know it because I am employed as a C# developer.
  1. It has a really intuitive TDD backend. Everything is point and click
  1. Code generation is point and click so code can be created rapidly
  1. GUI development is simple and easily changed
    1. later we can develop a GTK equivalent and plug our C# code into that
  1. C# is platform independent through the Mono project
